R Programming Practice Questions

1)Perform Matrix Manipulation in R
  a. Create a 3 × 3 matrix matE with every entry equal to 0. Check what the functions row and col return when applied to matE. Hence create the 6 × 6 matrix.
  b. Perform Matrix Addition and Matrix Subtraction in R.
  
2)Demonstrate Factor data structure in R.
  a. Create a factor gender with levels female and male.
  b. Use is.factor() is used to check whether the variable is a factor and returns “TRUE” if it is a factor
  
3)Create a data frame and print the structure of the data frame in R.
  a. Create a data frame of 5 sonar company Employee details:
 	  ID, NAME, OCCUPATION, EMPLOYEE
  b. Apply summary() to find the summary of the data in the data frame and display the results.
  c. Extract data(OCCUPATION) from the data frame.
  d. Expand data frame include SALARY
  
4) Demonstrate the use of functions 
       a. Develop a simple calculator in R.
       b. Write a function called kelvin_to_celsius() that takes a temperature in Kelvin and returns 
            that temperature in Celsius (Hint: To convert from Kelvin to Celsius you subtract 273.15)
       c. Demonstrate the creation of a complex number in R.
       
5)Write the Commands to Perform Basic Arithmetic in R.
     a.	Calculate the square roots of 729
    b.	In each case, what is the value of x?  (Try to think it through before you try it in R)
	    i)x<-2-1*2
	    ii)x<-6/3-2+1*0+3/3-3
